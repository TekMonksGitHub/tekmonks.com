#MonBoss
<p style="font-size:25px; text-align:center">AI System to monitor and fix infrastructure</p>

An AIOps or Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations is what MonBoss is all about. It monitors Enterprise Application and middleware outages in databases, applications, or HTTP servers, always on a lookout for anything that needs to be fixed. It can even go to a low-level correction of problems on Virtual Machine (VM) outages as well as network issues.

MonBoss is imperative to infrastructure monitoring for detection and quick resolution without human intervention. Saving costs as it proactively eliminates if not minimizes downtime.  In the absence of consistent monitoring, System Administrators are always at the helm since any outages or issues may potentially take several hours to be dealt with.

As an infrastructure monitoring software, MonBoss utilizes AI as a service through AI algorithms based on its analysis on failure in finding efficient solutions for problems encountered.
