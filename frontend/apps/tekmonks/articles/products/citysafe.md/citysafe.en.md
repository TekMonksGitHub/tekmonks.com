<p style="font-size:25px; text-align:center">To Serve and To Cyber-Protect</p>

CitySafe, a plug and play cybersecurity AI service, is TekMonks response to hackers asking bitcoin payment (to avoid traceability and safeguard anonymity) as they hold a city or government hostage. Designed and developed in the rampancy of ransomware attacks across the country, locales are held captive while their captors demand ransom for threats of being shut out of their own systems.

It is a much-needed protection specific for local government data and safety in a period of cyber security situation where attacks are quick, easy, and well researched. Acquiring login through the most vulnerable access point just to steal data to create havoc that compromises even a secured backend server.

A patented technology by TekMonks, CitySafe allows operating “Listenless” servers. “Listenless” it is, means that associated servers are designed not to listen on any external ports nor accept any traffic. Making it completely isolated, hence unhackable. Still, it participates in the reflection network that allows continued delivery of data to external clients.

**“Anything that cannot be accessed is unhackable”**

The logical behavior of reflection is that anyone who tries to touch what they are seeing, practically touches the mirror instead. It is a futile attempt to attack a reflection, since the actual person or in this case, server, remains unharmed.

In the case of a SmartFirewall Reflection, a server may look like an HTTP server but do not contain any real HTML files. In some instances, it may look like a Database server, but no real filesystem of actual data is within. Anyone who tries a known hack on a reflection server will find it is immune, as it is not even running the HTTP or Database. Acquiring immunity to any attack as they are not real, even if it looks and behaves like real. 

Reflections can be set up quickly without having to upgrade any existing systems.
