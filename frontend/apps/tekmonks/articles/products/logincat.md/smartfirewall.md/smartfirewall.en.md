#LoginCat Smart Firewall
##Don’t just settle on Firewall, use Smart Firewall
<br/>
Firewalls are often the first line of defense for network and data protection. Cyber criminals can use any internet connection or Wi-Fi network as an entry point into any computer machine. 

When a hacker install malware or exploits a zero-day exploit on an
any computer machine, easy access to a secure internal network is established. This happens in the event a user logs on which is synonymous to tailgating. Once connected to the internal network, traditional firewalls fail. As a user continues working, the hacker uses background scripts to scan and find vulnerable corporate systems and hack them. The hackers can easily crack passwords for internal applications. Then log into them and steal data without being detected or challenged.

So, better be safe than sorry by relying simply on a firewall. Instead, go for Smart Firewall.

The SmartFirewall from LoginCat™ is not just a typical firewall. It not only blocks entry points for all possible attackers by authenticating users but identifies the Internet Protocol (IP) address to further verify users. Hence, authorized users are the only ones allowed to log-in.

Apart from the IPs, applications which allow access to are also authenticated. So even if a Hacker compromised a machine or laptop of a user, they still cannot access anything the user did not click on. Web facing systems cannot be compromised as well because SmartFirewall is blocking all non-intent based access.

As a self-configuring firewall, Smart Firewall does not need to specify applications, ports, users, or policies – totally SMART!

Consider LoginCat Smart Firewall as a black hole! Because in a black hole, no one can get in.
