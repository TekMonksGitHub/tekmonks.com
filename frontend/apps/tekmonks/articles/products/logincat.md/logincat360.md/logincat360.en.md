<p style="font-size:25px; text-align:center">Zero trust network Cyber Security Solutions</p>

LoginCat, the worldâ€™s first comprehensive Cyber Security suite and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a Zero Trust based application security. 
A unified cyber security solution, LoginCat is designed for malware protection and anti-phishing up to the worst-case scenario that may threaten internal network applications, and even the cloud environment.

LoginCat fully supports Multi Factor Authentication, Single Sign-On (SSO) with zero modification, as well as SSO to non-web applications, and even Mobile from Android, iOS, to Windows. 
 
To prevent hacking, LoginCat can implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for that protection of businesses of access to online platforms, where succeeding authentications can be in the form of a One-Time Passcode (OTP) or Biometric. Designed to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access, the security protocol is a conscious effort to retain customers relying only with the traditional username and password system login. Users are at risk of compromised passwords than they realize, particularly in using the same password on more than one website.
 
Another strong feature that LoginCat has is the configurable frequency of changing passwords. Whether it is weekly or 30 to 90 days, security risks from exposure can be reduced avoiding dangers from hackers gaining access and worst, data breach.
 
LoginCat, the best malware protection, counters cyber-attacks at zero cost and risk to secure existing applications. No requirement to modify existing
applications, it constantly provides firmware updates to include the latest security and AI algorithms to protect against emerging threats.

Appliance or Cloud-Based: bring us on-premises with an appliance or run LoginCat via our hosted cloud.

What is more, LoginCat even helps in meeting Regulatory Compliance Standards.
