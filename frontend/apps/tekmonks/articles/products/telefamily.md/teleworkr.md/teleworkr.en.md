TekMonks have been disrupting the IT industry by offering cutting edge solutions in everything from custom built software to Teleworking. Consistent in bringing innovative software solutions, TekMonks have addressed the growth of remote work perceived to have resulted in a decline in the productivity of the working class.

To fix the issues surrounding remote work and productivity, companies must invest in a comprehensive product that touches on imperative social psychology needs. TeleWorkr does just that, paving the way for remote work to be a viable option. 

TeleWorkr, a proprietary of TekMonks, is the world’s first and by far, the only all-in-one digital office that can provide organizations with:

● Secured and managed remote access solution that requires no additional software beyond a web browser to access.
●  Cyber-secured multi factor login via Zero Trust Technology to access all business applications
●  Remote working desk showing coworkers working together, for a virtual office like experience, removing isolation, and restores the atmosphere as well as discipline of the real office.
●  Role based access portal ensuring that only employees can access resources they are authorized to access.
●  SmartFirewall with “Virtual Segmented Network” isolation, protecting organizations and remote workers in such a way that hackers cannot even find a network path to the remote machines. 

TeleWorkr allows employees’ remote access to their office desktops and applications and a virtual office-like psychological environment. It can even track workers checking on Social Media while they are on their laptop and mark as "taking a break". 

TeleWorkr with its very own video/chat tool, Telimeet, tackles the consideration of social interactions, giving employees the ability to create casual, non-scheduled video calls.  This secured video conferencing is compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) and other audits.
