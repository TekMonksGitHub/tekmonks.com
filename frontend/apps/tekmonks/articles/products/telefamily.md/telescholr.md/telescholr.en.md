<p style="font-size:25px; text-align:center">Digital learning with digital proximity</p>

TeleScholr is a fully customizable and intuitive software solution for digital learning. The only fully integrated Digital School platform in the market, it is made ground up for running learning institutions digitally. It is the ability to curate the platform to meet school’s requirements, provide a secure learning environment, track students, and deliver reliable online managed schools. 

Furthermore, what sets TeleScholr apart from other online learning platforms are the following features:

●  Accountability through My Class and telepresence  for a unified digital learning experience. Allowing teachers and students to have transparency where everyone can see each just like a physical classroom
●  Secured communication through a built-in communication, Telemeet. This secured video conferencing, chat, and file sharing is accessible only to those who are part of the class
●  Secured connectivity that utilizes the advantages of Reflection technology coupled with zero trust cybersecurity, LoginCat, for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
●  Academic compliance through a central admin console for system administration with audit logs for academic reports, accounting, and billing purposes.
●  Easy set up and Installation by simply installing Telescholr agent on a desktop through an executable (.exe) file or deploy enterprise wide via a simple virtual machine. Hence, no need to modify the existing network configuration.

A complete digital school, not just a remote access, TeleScholr can even track students checking on social media while on their device and their status reflects as ‘taking a break’.

What is more, a virtual whiteboard is readily available for taking notes and drawing pictures. A good tool to further clarify lesson details that can even save images and text in an online folder.

Stop using a mishmash of applications which are not designed for schooling. Because the market beating price of Telescholar is surely to save more while fully stacked with not one but lots of features.
