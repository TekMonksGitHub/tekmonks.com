#Reflection Network
<p style="font-size:25px; text-align:center">You can’t attack what you can’t access</p>

Mirror image of a person acts and behaves identical to him. If attacked, he remains unharmed since the reflection is not the actual person. Reflections are inherently safe because it’s the mirror that they are touching and not the person. 
The SmartFirewall reflection server works the same as it acts and behaves similar to the actual server. It may look like an HTTP server without the HTML files contained. It may seem like a Database server but no real filesystem with actual data can be found. So, an attack on a reflection server is worthless as it is not even running the HTTP nor Database. 
Reflection Network SmartFirewall Reflector is a TCP/IP protocol level reflection-based network. A patented technology created by TekMonks, SmartFirewall Reflection Network allows operation of so called “Listenless servers”. As the name implies, it does not listen on external ports, nor accept traffic. Hence, it is unhackable being completely isolated. However, participating in the reflection network, they are still able to serve data to external clients.

###Key Features:
● Immune to all attacks as they are not real but look and behave as if authentic.
● Reflectors can be set up quickly to reflect servers where the actual servers will not be connecting to the clients. 
● Actual servers need not listen to any ports or even allow incoming connections. It is the reflector which opens an outbound connection to the reflection server. 
● External clients connect to the reflection server then reuses pre-existing connections to serve the clients. 
● All communications are AES-256 encrypted, hence no incoming network path from the reflection servers or clients. 

###Benefits:
●“Unhackable” since no real data is contained and it can't even open a path to the actual servers.
●“Listenless servers” don't listen on any TCP/IP port not allowing incoming connection yet continue to serve data and information out to the clients.
●“Cyber killchain” is prevented from Malware, Spear Fishing, and Password Theft that can compromise a secure backend corporate server.
