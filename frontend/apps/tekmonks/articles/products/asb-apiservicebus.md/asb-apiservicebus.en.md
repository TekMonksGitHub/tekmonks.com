#API Service Bus

Application Programming Interface (API) Service Bus  is the first, and so far the only API Integration Bus, designed by TekMonks specifically for modern API based applications as well as API economy.

API Service Bus (ASB) supports grouping operations against a single messaging entity within the scope of a single transaction. Where, a message entity can be a queue, topic, or subscription.

Businesses need a lightweight, high performance, asynchronous, API Based Integration platform in a "data and message first" world of REST APIs. ASB can deliver that with their key and additional features beneficial to companies.

###Key Features:
API Service Bus can easily:
●	Enable partner endpoints to existing Enterprise systems 
●	Orchestrate and connect APIs to each other, enabling information to flow 
●	Convert existing systems and data to API Endpoints exposed to internal and external partners
●	Compose new APIs by orchestrating existing APIs
●	Secure API endpoints with encrypted JSON and API keys
●	Messages are event driven since asynchronous and not based on waterfall like flow models. 
●	Message based data flows as a foundation for (near) real-time and also batch processing
●	In the past, everything was built on data stores (data at rest), making it impossible to build flexible, agile services to act on data while it is relevant.
●	Act as the central asynchronous bus for events between any number of sources and sinks. 


###Added Features:
Future proof, ASB is built for futuristic AI Based applications, which need to move large amounts of data and events for machine learning and AI processing engines.
●	A bus built by design for zero downtime, handling the failure of services and nodes and networks and rolling upgrades. 
●	Proven capability to process millions of messages an hour, using only 2 cores and with minimal memory requirements due to the asynchronous I/O and lightweight JSON architecture of the bus.
●	Transform data and events from any format to JSON / APIs. 
●	Message based routing implies data is processed when it is available by applications which can use it to drive business processes forward

###Benefits:
●	**Flexibility** - Scales from API microservices exposed by partners, to multi-gigabytes of data produced by batch jobs
●	**Message Driven Flows** - APIs use Request/Response model and are messaging endpoints. ASB is designed ground up for routing, transforming and orchestrating such messages, thereby transforming old systems into modern API endpoints.
●	**Independent and decoupled business microservice APIs** - The APIs are managed as products, with their own lifecycle. Loose coupling allows for independent processing between producers and consumers.
●	**Very High Scalability** - Due to the asynchronous I/O based architecture, and the lightweight JSON data model. Reducing cloud and infrastructure costs.
●	**JSON Data Support** - For high-speed, rich JSON transformations
